	Cryptonut is a cryptocurrency trading simulator. Our platform allows users to create an account, manage their funds across various cryptocurrencies, and participate in challenges. From new investors looking to learn the basics of trading to veterans wanting to practice advanced techniques, the Cryptonut platform makes it easy.
	Users can register/sign in from the SIGN IN page. On their profile page, a user can change their username and password.
	Live and historical values for all major cryptocurrencies are clearly displayed on the EXCHANGE page. Users can select a base currency and view all prices here.
	From the TRADE page, users can exchange between different currencies.
	In the WALLET, users can view their historical investments, current investment portfolio including losses/gains, and they can add or remove funds.
	Every user profile will have achievements to complete. These are on the ACHIEVEMENTS page.
	On the CHALLENGES page, current challenges can be viewed and entered. Upon challenge entry, a user is granted a fixed amount of funds of a certain currency. They are free to exchange those funds for any other currencies until the challenge period is over. When a challenge is finished, users are ranked by the growth in their challenge funds, measured in the starting currency. There are leaderboards and recognition for the top investors available for each challenge.
